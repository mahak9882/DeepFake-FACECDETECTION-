## 📌 Project Overview

**DeepXpose** is a robust and scalable deep learning model designed to detect manipulated videos (deepfakes) using a **hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture**. This system leverages spatial features extracted by CNNs and temporal dependencies captured through Transformers to deliver state-of-the-art performance on deepfake detection.

This project is part of a research initiative focused on enhancing the transparency and reliability of digital media content.
